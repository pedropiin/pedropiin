### Hi there 👋 I'm Pedro.
I'm a Computer Science student at University of Campinas (UNICAMP).
I started my coding journey when I entered the university (2022) and instantly fell in love with it.
I try to learn different topics by making small independent projects. Currently I'm learning machine learning theory.
