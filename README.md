##  Hi there, I'm Pedro 👋

- 📕 I'm a Computer Science student at [University of Campinas (UNICAMP)](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/).
- 👨‍💻 I started my coding journey when I entered the university (2022) and instantly fell in love with it.
- 🤖 I try to learn different topics by making small independent projects. Currently I'm learning functional programming, cryptography, fully homomorphic encryption and compilers.
